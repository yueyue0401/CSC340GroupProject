## Project Title
The Most Profitable Actors by Movie Genre

## Goal
The goal of this project is to find which actor among the dataset correlates to the highest revenue produced for movies within each movie genre. Although this relationship does not necessarily imply causation, our goal is to simply examine the association.

## Why
We chose this dataset because we are all cinephiles to some degree, and being self-quarantined has given us more opportunities to watch them. This will provide us an interesting new way to select movies to watch in each genre
